This is an example frontend app that can be used as a starting point for a wide variety of apps.

Features

- On-demand meeting bot: Instantly send a bot to any meeting platform - all you need is the link!
- AI transcription, summaries, and sentiment: Uses the intelligence capabilities of multiple industry-leading generative AI providers, all through Recall's unified API.

This is only a glimpse into what you can build on top of Recall. The possibilities are [endless](/README.md)
